Small but not least changes: The Art of Creating Disruptive Innovations  
# Abstract  
In the ever-evolving landscape of technology, product innovation emerges through the replacement of outdated technologies with groundbreaking advancements or the creative fusion of diverse technologies. This pioneering study employs a genetic framework to represent products, extracting chromosomal data to construct a comprehensive phylogenetic network of automobiles. By highlighting the significance of technological features, we delve into the product phylogenetic network (Lee et al., 2022). By introducing the revolutionary ‘Product Disruption Index’—inspired by the D index (Wu et al., 2019)—to this network, we can measure a product’s disruptiveness. Our approach is validated against the well-documented trend of declining disruptiveness over time (Park et al., 2023) and substantiated through two compelling case studies. Statistical analysis reveals that disruptive innovations often stem from minor, yet pivotal, modifications. Furthermore, inheriting superior technologies from predecessors and making slight adjustments to key technologies are more effective in enhancing a product’s disruptiveness than extensive technological changes. Indeed, a small step on the shoulders of giants can lead to monumental strides in disruptive innovation.  #
